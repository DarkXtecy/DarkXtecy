- 👋 Hi, I’m @DarkXtecy
- 👀 I’m interested in everything that's involved with full stack web-development and cybersecurity.... also I like gaming and reading comics, and few other things that I havent listed here 😅.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basic languages like HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript. I regard myself as a beginner when it comes to coding. However, I have been using Wordpress a lot so most of the web designing I do are from the prebuilt templates for Wordpress.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small scale web designing projects and progressively rise to large scale projects, but not just limited to web designing, I want to explore and be involved in anything from building programs to testing it.... at least for now.
- 📫 How to reach me : you can contact me through email ( zakibhingraj@yahoo.com )
